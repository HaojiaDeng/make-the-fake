Phaser's major components used:
physics: somehow the addcollider() function failed. I cannot find out the way to fix that.
cameras: I use the camera.pan() function to create a cutscene.
particle effects: I use it to create fire particle to make it more visually interesting
text objects
the tween manager: I use it to make texts with special effect.
timers: there is a countdown in game to make it more challenging
